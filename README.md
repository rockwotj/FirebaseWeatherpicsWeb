# FirebaseWeatherpicsWeb
Weatherpics with AngularFire. This was written for the [Android](https://github.com/AndroidCourseMaterial) and [iOS](https://github.com/iOSCourseMaterial) courses at [Rose-Hulman](https://www.rose-hulman.edu). There are lessons which create Android and iOS apps of Weatherpics and this is a web client to compliment them. It also shows off Firebase's sync features. 

## Setup

This project uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). In order to build the webapp you must first run `npm install` to install the dependancies and then `gulp` to build the project. 

To run the project you can then start a webserver from the build directory using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. After that you should be able to view your project at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
