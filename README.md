# FirebaseWeatherpicsWeb
Weatherpics with AngularFire. This was written for the [Android](https://github.com/AndroidCourseMaterial) and [iOS](https://github.com/iOSCourseMaterial) courses at [Rose-Hulman](https://www.rose-hulman.edu). There are lessons which create Android and iOS apps of Weatherpics and this is a web client to compliment them. It also shows off Firebase's sync features.
